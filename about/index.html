              <h2>Experience from Around the World</h2>
                <p> The beauty of the 21st century is the ability to travel and interact with people from around the world.  The last 4 years I've lived in the Middle East, in a country called the United Arab Emirates.  Most people refer to it as Dubai, a major city in the country.  The country itself has put a priority on working with the expat population (approximately 85% of the country).  In doing this they hire english speaking teachers to work in the schools, the job I have done for the last 4 years.  In doing this job I have worked with professionals from the UAE, Egypt, South Africa, Canada, England, and Ireland to name a few.  This experience has benefited me in learning to see and work with different perspecives.  Prior to this experience I taught in the inner-city, in rural Alaska and suburban Richmond, VA.  </p>

              <p> The variety of experience I bring, just through education, has been amazing.  The people I've worked with, interacted with and learned from have given me more wisdom than I could have on my own.  And let's be honest, that's only my teaching experience.  There were years of customer service prior to that which led to more experiences and wisdom brought from those around me. But experience can't be held to just the professional part of life.  You should look at travel as well.  I've had the opportunity to see the beauty of Sri Lanka, the history of Italy, the food of France, and experienced India.  When you look at these places, adding in living throughout the United States, New Zealand, and the United Arab Emirates, I've found that everyplace I go, every person I interact with, has taught me something I didn't know before.  My daughter learns just as much and teaches me throughout these trips.  She teaches me things I hadn't thought to ask or think about before.  These experiences bring me to who I am today and who I will be tomorrow. </p>

            <h2> Education - The Formal Part </h2>
              <h3> Education comes in a variety of ways.  One is through experience and one is through formal education either by certification programs or degrees.  I have found that I enjoy learning, almost as much as I enjoy traveling.</h3>
                  <p> <em>SkillCrush All-Access Blueprint</em> - July 2017-present.  Learning how to code through HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, etc.</p>

                  <p> <em>Bellevue University, Bellevue, Nebraska.</em>  June 2010-August 2013.  Master's of Science in Clinical Counseling.  I was trained in clinical counseling with a greater emphasis on psychotherapy.  My specialty is working with women in areas of trauma or depression emphasis in post-pardem depression and sexual assault.</p>
                  <p> <em>Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.</em>  January 2005-August 2006.  Master's of Education in Emotional Disturbance.

Anthropology is the study of people and their culture.  When you look at this as the base of the pyramid, you see it grow and become a bit more specialized with each step but it all relates to people. </p>

            <h2> Time To Get Personal </h2>
            <img src="../img/liz-tracy.jpg" alt="LizTracy">
              <p> Let's be honest, I'm a person.  Who I am matters, whether you're looking for help with your project, a new friend or some advice on how to survive the current situation.  So let's get personal.  I'm a single mom - yeah, I know.  Craziest thing I've ever done was decide to raise my daughter on my own.  She teaches me a lot, sometimes I wonder who the teacher is.  I've learned a lot from her over time and she's changed my world, for the better.  She brings a perspective to things I wouldn't have considered before.  Fortunately I've had some great people come into my life to help me with the raising of her.  Some people have stayed, some have moved on in one form or another but I've appreciated each person who's come in and helped me, even those who taught me hard lessons that hurt.  She's also taught me to be more grateful about life, to stop and smell the roses and enjoy the rain as much as the sunshine. </p>
              <p> But how do I stay sane as a mom?  I'll be the first to admit I have a running problem.  I'm ever so grateful for <a href="https://www.fellowflowers.com">Fellow Flowers</a>.  This running group is by women and for women.  I couldn't imagine doing everything I've done without the support of these women.  I've been able to make friends and feel a part of something, even on the other side of the world.
              <p> Besides my daughter and running, I'm pretty basic.  I read, drink wine and do my best to learn.  That's it.  That's who I am.  And I love it.  Each day I learn more and figure out what else I can do to help the world and make it a better place.  And that's really what we all need to do. </p>
              <p> One more thing - I LOVE quotes!  And here are some of my favorite!  Check back from time to time to see what else I've added! </p>
