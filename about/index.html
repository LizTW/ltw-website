            <h2>Experience from Around the World</h2>
                <p> The beauty of the 21st century is the ability to travel and interact with people from around the world.  The last 4 years I've lived in the Middle East, in a country called the United Arab Emirates.  Most people refer to it as Dubai, a major city in the country.  The country itself has put a priority on working with the expat population (approximately 85% of the country).  In doing this they hire english speaking teachers to work in the schools, the job I have done for the last 4 years.  In doing this job I have worked with professionals from the UAE, Egypt, South Africa, Canada, England, and Ireland to name a few.  This experience has benefited me in learning to see and work with different perspecives.  Prior to this experience I taught in the inner-city, in rural Alaska and suburban Richmond, VA.  The variety of experience I bring, just through education, has been amazing.  The people I've worked with, interacted with and learned from have given me more wisdom than I could have on my own.  And let's be honest, that's only my teaching experience.  There were years of customer service prior to that which led to more experiences and wisdom brought from those around me. </p>

              <p> But experience can't be held to just the professional part of life.  You should look at travel as well.  I've had the opportunity to see the beauty of Sri Lanka, the history of Italy, the food of France, and experienced India.  When you look at these places, adding in living throughout the United States, New Zealand, and the United Arab Emirates, I've found that everyplace I go, every person I interact with, has taught me something I didn't know before.  My daughter learns just as much and teaches me throughout these trips.  She teaches me things I hadn't thought to ask or think about before.  These experiences bring me to who I am today and who I will be tomorrow. </p>
